# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for deciding to contribute to EvenCart. The page describes the guidelines that you should follow before you contribute.

### Contributor License Agreement

All the contributions to project EvenCart are governed by [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://evencart.co/contributor-license-agreement). By contributing to EvenCart, you agree to abide by CLA. Any submission of pull requests to EvenCart GitHub Repository will automatically mean that you as the contributor agree to abide by CLA.

### Types of Contributions

You can contribute to EvenCart in a couple of ways.

1. **Bug Reports** - You can create GitHub issues for any bugs that you encounter in EvenCart. Just make sure that there is not an existing issue for the same bug that you are reporting. If the bug you found is [already an open issue](https://github.com/evencart/evencart/issues), please add to that thread instead of creating new issue.  
2. **Source Code Contribution** - You can share your bug fixes or feature development as GitHub pull requests. However before you start working on something, please make sure if somebody else is not working on same feature or fix or if there is any pending [pull request](https://github.com/evencart/evencart/pulls).
3. **Blog Posts** - You can contribute by writing blogs, tutorials or marketing materials for EvenCart. You can either write blog post on your own domain, our [EvenCart blog](https://evencart.co/blog) or third party sites like CSharpCorner.

### Source Code Contribution

1. Create GitHub fork of [EvenCart repository](https://github.com/evencart/evencart).

2. Create new branches like `feature/<feature-name>` or `issue/<issue-title>` depending on if you are developing a new feature or fixing an existing bug. Make sure that your base branch is `dev` as it contains the latest code for any future releases.

   > Do not directly modify `master` or `dev` branches of your forked repository.

3. Start commits to the branch as soon as possible. Make sure that your source code follows EvenCart source code guidelines.

4. Write extensive tests for the feature you are developing.

5. Submit a pull request. 

   > Note : Submitting a pull request does not necessarily mean that the request will be accepted. If your pull request is not accepted or merged to the EvenCart official repository, that doesn't mean it's not useful. It's just that we may not think it usable for the product.
